my website, powered by cloudflare workers ⛅️

## about

my [previous site](https://old.thekelvinliu.com) was written in vue
and needed javascript at runtime in order to render.

this one is completely different.
it features:

- absolutely no javascript required
- hand-written css and html
- low-/no-cost hosting on backblaze b2 and cloudflare workers
  via [cloud-blaze](https://github.com/thekelvinliu/cloud-blaze)
- minified code by cloudflare
- perfect lighthouse score (minus seo)
