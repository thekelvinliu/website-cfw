      <h1>#BLACKLIVESMATTER</h1>
      <p>
        i'll keep this short.
        everyone, myself included, benefits and enjoys black culture in one form or another.
        but most of us don't need to pay the black tax.
        if that feels wrong, it's because it is.
        if it doesn't, check your privilege and
        <a href="//bit.ly/antiracistresources" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="anti-racism resources">educate yourself</a>.
        also
        <a href="//blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/#donate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="donation links">donate</a>.
        keep in mind that neither of these are one-time things.
      </p>
      <p>
        i'm not going to pretend that i actually know or fully understand the black experience;
        i am not black, it is just not possible, and it would be wrong to say i did.
        what i can do is offer my compassion, ears, eyes, money, platform, services, time, etc.
